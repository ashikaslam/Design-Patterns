# ðŸŽ¯ Python Design Patterns (Learning Repository)

This repository contains my personal learning journey into the world of **Design Patterns** using Python. I took this course primarily to become **familiar** with the core patterns used in software design, rather than to master all of them immediately. Over time, I plan to revisit and deepen my understanding.

## ðŸ“š Course Reference

Iâ€™m following the **Design Patterns in Python** course by **Code with Mosh**, which provides a clear and practical introduction to the classic **23 GoF (Gang of Four) design patterns**. This course covers:

- Behavioral Patterns
- Structural Patterns
- Creational Patterns

> **Note:** The course examples are written in **Java**, but I focus on **understanding the concepts** and then try to reimplement each pattern in **Python**â€”my favorite languageâ€”sometimes with the help of **AI tools** like ChatGPT. This process helps reinforce my understanding through hands-on practice.

I found the explanations simple yet powerful, and I highly recommend this course for any backend developer looking to strengthen their OOP and system design fundamentals.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Repository

- To **explore all 23 design patterns** one by one.
- To document each pattern with a **Markdown explanation file (`.md`)**.
- To implement each pattern with a clean and commented **Python script (`.py`)**.
- To build a **personal reference** I can revisit when working on real projects.

## ðŸ“Œ What Youâ€™ll Find Here

For each pattern:

- A `.md` file including:
  - Definition
  - Purpose
  - Use cases
  - Advantages and disadvantages
  - UML structure explained in text
  - Takeaway summary

- A `.py` file with:
  - A classical example
  - Beginner-friendly inline comments
  - Clear and modular structure

## ðŸ’¡ Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns are **proven solutions** to common software design problems. They help developers write more flexible, maintainable, and scalable code by applying standard, battle-tested strategies.

Even just being **familiar** with these patterns improves your:
- Problem-solving ability
- Communication with other developers
- Ability to recognize and apply patterns in real-world codebases

## ðŸ§  Final Note

This repository is not meant to be a complete academic reference, but a **personal roadmap and sandbox** for learning. If you're also learning design patterns and want clean Python examples, feel free to explore and fork!
