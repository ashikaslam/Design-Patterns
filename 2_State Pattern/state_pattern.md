# State Design Pattern

## Definition
The **State Pattern** allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

## Purpose
To avoid complex conditional logic (like `if` or `switch` statements) that check an object's state and perform different actions accordingly.

## Components
- **Context**: The object that has a state and whose behavior varies depending on its current state.
- **State Interface**: Declares methods that all concrete states must implement.
- **Concrete States**: Each class implements a behavior associated with a particular state.

## Real-World Analogy
Think of a media player:
- When it's in **Playing** state, clicking the play button **pauses** the music.
- When it's in **Paused** state, clicking the play button **resumes** the music.

The behavior changes depending on the state.

## When to Use
- When an object’s behavior depends on its state, and it must change behavior at runtime.
- When you have state-specific behavior spread across many conditionals.

## When Not to Use
- When states don’t change dynamically at runtime.
- When a simple strategy pattern or conditional logic would suffice.

## Benefits
- Cleaner code (no need for large if/else or switch/case statements).
- Easier to extend with new states without modifying existing ones (Open/Closed Principle).
- Improves maintainability.

## Drawbacks
- Can lead to a large number of small classes.
- Adds complexity if states are simple and don’t change often.

## Common Use Cases
- UI state management (e.g., buttons, forms).
- Finite state machines.
- Game character states (e.g., jumping, walking, attacking).
- Network connection status (e.g., connected, disconnected, reconnecting).
